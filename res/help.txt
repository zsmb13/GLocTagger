Usage:
java -jar GLocTagger.jar <location data json> <input directory> <output directory> <time offset from utc> [optional args]

See available optional arguments below.

---

>> Accuracy filter (-a, --accuracy)

Defines a maximum amount of uncertainty for location records to allow.
-a <max value in meters>
Example, only use records that are accurate within 40 meters:
-a 40

---

>> Location filters

> Restrict filter (-r, --restrict)

Restricts the used records to those that are within a given radius of a given pair of coordinates.
-r <latitude> <longitude> <radius in kilometers>
Example, only use records within 2 kilometers of The White House:
-r 38.897440 -77.036584 2
Note that you can not use multiple restrict filters together to mark multiple circles on a map that are allowed.

> Exclude filter (-e, --exclude)

Ignores location records within a given radius of a given pair of coordinates.
-e <latitude> <longitude> <radius in kilometers>
Example, ignore location records within 10 kilometers of The White House:
-e 38.897440 -77.036584 10

---

>> Time filters

Both filters use ISO-8601, the YYYY-MM-DD format.

> From filter (-f, --from)
Defines a start date for the records to consider (inclusive).
-f <start date>

> Until filter (-u, --until)
Defines an end date for the records to consider (inclusive).
-u <end date>

Combined example, only look for records that happened from Christmas until the end of the year (again, inclusive of the bounds):
-f 2015-12-24 -u 2015-12-31
