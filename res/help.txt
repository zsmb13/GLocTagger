>> Location filters

> Restrict filter

Restricts the used records to those that are within a given radius of a given pair of coordinates.
-restrict <latitude> <longitude> <radius in kilometers>

Example, only use records within 2 kilometers of The White House:
-restrict 38.897440 -77.036584 2

Note that you can not use multiple restrict filters together to mark multiple circles on a map that are allowed. Sorry.

> Exclude filter

Ignores location records within a given radius of a given pair of coordinates.
-exclude <latitude> <longitude> <radius in kilometers>

Example, ignore location records within 10 kilometers of The White House:
-exclude 38.897440 -77.036584 10

---

>> Time filters

Both filters use ISO-8601, the YYYY-MM-DD format.

> From filter
Defines a start date for the records to consider (inclusive).
-from <start date>

> Until filter
Defines an end date for the records to consider (inclusive).
-until <end date>

Combined example, only look for records that happened between Christmas and New Year's (again, inclusive of the bounds):
-from 2015-12-24 -until 2015-12-31
