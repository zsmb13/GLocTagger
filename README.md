# GLocTagger

This program uses your location data from Google that you can download from Google Takeout to add GPS data to your JPG photos. This is useful if you're taking pictures with a camera that doesn't have GPS built in, but your location is recorded by your phone.

You can download your location history from Takeout [here](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/custom/location_history).

## Usage
`java -jar GLocTagger.jar <location data json> <input directory> <output directory> <time offset from utc> [optional args]`

The program creates a copy of your files in the output directory, it does not modify your original files.

Time offset is an integer representing the timezone where the photos were taken as an offset from UTC time, as cameras do not consider timezones when writing date and time information. Format examples: `-3`, `5`, `+2`, `0`.

## Optional arguments

### Miscellaneous filters

##### Accuracy filter `-a, --accuracy`

Defines a maximum amount of uncertainty for location records to allow.

`-a <max value in meters>`

Example, only use records that are accurate within 40 meters:

`-a 40`

### Location filters

##### Restrict filter `-r, --restrict`

Restricts the used records to those that are within a given radius of a given pair of coordinates.

`-r <latitude> <longitude> <radius in kilometers>`

Example, only use records within 2 kilometers of The White House:

`-r 38.897440 -77.036584 2`

Note that you can not use multiple restrict filters together to mark multiple circles on a map that are allowed.

##### Exclude filter `-e, --exclude`

Ignores location records within a given radius of a given pair of coordinates.

`-e <latitude> <longitude> <radius in kilometers>`

Example, ignore location records within 10 kilometers of The White House:

`-e 38.897440 -77.036584 10`

### Time filters

Both filters use ISO-8601, the YYYY-MM-DD format.

##### From filter `-f, --from`

Defines a start date for the records to consider (inclusive).

`-f <start date>`

##### Until filter `-u, --until`

Defines an end date for the records to consider (inclusive).

`-u <end date>`

Combined example, only look for records that happened from Christmas until the end of the year (again, inclusive of the bounds):

`-f 2015-12-24 -u 2015-12-31`
